## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data=Volcanoes)+
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=Volcano_Eruptive_Volume, y=Volcano_Frequency_in_years, color=Volcano_name))

```
